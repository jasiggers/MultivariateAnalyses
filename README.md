# Multivariate Analyses in Community Ecology

# Overview
This course is designed for students to learn how to manipulate and analyze ecological community datasets. Students will learn to apply statistical approaches
to their data in R programming language with the assistance of Numerical Ecology by Legendre et al. We will work through established examples, along with
datasets provided by Dr. Kivlin and potentially students' own datasets. Selecting the proper methods to best answer your research questions is the overarching
goal, so we hope to point you in the right direction and expose you to an abundance of statistical techniques. 

# This repository
This is where students & teachers will be expected to deposit their code associated with weekly topics. This repository will exist as a resource for students beyond the course duration.
Feel free to upload any cool/relevant examples under the title 'BonusExample_ShortDescription'
